Did you not only watch each episode back in the day when you had to wait *<em>one whole, entire, long, 7-day week</em>* for each new episode (not knowing if Rachel and Ross were going to get back together or not? :weary:) but currently binge the seasons over and over on Netflix? Let's test your Friends knowledge just to see how well you "know your Friends."
